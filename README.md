# CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science

This is perphaps the most exciting course which I have ever taken since the university even though it is only an online introdution course. What really impressed me is the passion that David(Lecturer of CS50) passed through 
the intensice lectures where I learned C, python and flask, html, CSS and javascript. After scratching my head into the problem sets, I feel more confident to actually program on my own. Unlike the teaching style which I used to have - robotic repeating 
books, I finally felt the pleasure of catching up with the lecturer. Throughout finishing all the problem sets given, the words 
in the first course - **CS is a tool we can use to do more powerful and interesting things in any other field.**  make more senses 
to me.

## Problem sets summary
* Pset3 - resize that resizes (i.e., enlarges or shrinks) 24-bit uncompressed BMPs by a factor of f with C.
* Pset4 - implement a program that spell-checks a file.
* Pset8 - toy website to quote, buy and sell the stock.
